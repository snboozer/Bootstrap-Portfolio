        I was born on May 30th 1988 in Philadelphia, PA. I am the youngest of five children and referred to as 
        "The Baby". This nickname has never been my favorite. When I was a teenager, I told
        my siblings that "my parents stopped having kids when they got it right." On September 30, 2011, I helped to extend
        my family tree by having a baby girl named Jaiyde. Being a mom has been the most exciting and nerve wrecking
        time of my life, but I wouldn't change it for anything. Between my daughter and her 11 frist cousins, there is 
        never a dull moment for my family.
        <br> <br>


        I currently work in the social work field with pregnant and parenting teens. This will be my 6th year in this postion
        and I am ready for a change! I have been working in the Web Development field for the past 2 weeks and can say whole
        heartedly that this has been the most challenging time I have had in all my years of education. I stumble a lot 
        with coding, but I can see myself getting better and grasping the concepts more each week. I can't wait to see where
        I will be in October!
